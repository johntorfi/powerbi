# Financial Insights Dashboard: Empowering Data-driven Decision Making ( Power BI)Financial Insights Dashboard: Empowering Data-driven Decision Making ( Power BI)
I have developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for the financial domain, showcasing my proficiency in income statement analysis and revenue insights. The dashboard comprises two pages, with the income statement section offering flexible customization options and time filtering capabilities. The revenue insight page features a dynamic interface that allows filtering by territory, channel, and year, incorporating a waterfall chart for sales analysis, a detailed table displaying key metrics, and charts highlighting the top five customers and cities by total sales. Throughout the project, I employed effective data structuring, implemented financial report templates, and utilized appropriate DAX formulas, resulting in a visually appealing and functional dashboard for financial analysis.
